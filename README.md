# bootstrap-resume

Take your HTML Resume and updated it using bootstrap!

Start a new project for this excercise by following the Exercise Checklist

Once you are in VS Code you will need to create a new index file, and a new css file, then include the css inside the <head> of your html.

You will also need to include the bootstrap code inside the <head> of your html as well. Instructions can be found here:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/download/#bootstrapcdn

Once you've got that set up, start to build out your resume!

Include the following items:

Navigation
Intro (perhaps the jumbotron?)
Some skills
Cards that highlight some of your projects (include links)
Contact Info
Links to social networks
